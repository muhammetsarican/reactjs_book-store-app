I created a book store app with GraphQL and ReactJs from [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) GraphQL tutorial. When I was developing this project I had so fun and I learned so much things. My special thanks to Net Ninja for this tutorial üëè. I will visit your channel often from now on üéâ.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/muhammetsarican/reactjs_book-store-app.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd reactjs_book-store-app

```

**First you need to create the '.env' file in the backend directory. Then add the 'MONGO_URI' field to connect to MongoDb.**
Or you can run this code after add your mongo uri:
```bash
  echo 'MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>' > .env
```

**Project has two directories:**

First go backend directory and run this:
```bash
  npm install && npm run server
```

Second go client directory and run this:
```bash
  npm install && npm run client
```

Finally go the address that shown at terminal. Congrats üéâ
